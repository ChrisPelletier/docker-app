# Fun With Docker App

This is a fun docker application that I am developing to help me learn some new technologies and maybe turn it into something one day. The technologies being used are Docker, Flask and redis at the momment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

First to get this running you will need to install Docker. You can find instructions for installing Docker here:

```
https://docs.docker.com/install/
```

### Installing

After you install docker on your system you will need to build and start your containers using the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

This should create the containers and start them. You can then see the application running by entering http://localhost:5000 in your browser to see the Hello World message page
